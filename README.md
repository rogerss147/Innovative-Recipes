# Custom Recipe Sharing Platform

## Description
Create an online platform where users can share their favorite **customized** recipes. The goal is to go beyond traditional recipes and allow people to share their own variations, tips, and culinary tricks.

## Key Features
1. **User Profiles:**
   - Users can create profiles and add personal information, such as food preferences, dietary restrictions, and cooking skill level.
   - They can also upload a profile picture and write a brief description.

2. **Recipe Sharing:**
   - Users can create, edit, and share their customized recipes.
   - Each recipe should include ingredients, step-by-step instructions, and a photo of the final dish.
   - Users can add tags (e.g., "vegetarian," "gluten-free," "quick and easy") to facilitate searching.

3. **Ratings and Comments:**
   - Other users can rate and comment on shared recipes.
   - Ratings can include stars and detailed comments about taste, difficulty, and results.

4. **Smart Search:**
   - Implement an intelligent search mechanism that allows users to find recipes based on specific ingredients, preparation time, cuisine type, etc.

5. **Culinary Challenges:**
   - Create monthly or weekly challenges for users. For example, "Summer Dessert Challenge" or "Creative Vegan Dish."
   - Users can participate, share their creations, and gain recognition within the community.

6. **Active Community:**
   - Encourage interaction among users through forums, discussion groups, and virtual cooking classes.

## Suggested Technologies
- **Frontend:** Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an appealing user interface.
- **Backend:** Consider using Java (Spring Boot) or another language/framework of your choice to handle business logic and the database.
- **Database:** Utilize a relational database (e.g., MySQL) to store recipes, user profiles, and ratings.

Remember to adapt the idea according to your preferences and interests. Good luck with your project! üçΩÔ∏èüë®‚Äçüç≥
